# WorldXGen
A 3d map generator using probility distribution to create relief such as mountains and mountain range.
* Allow to apply a matrix, in order to alterate the initial map. For exemple you can simule erosion.
* Simule the generation of a river, starting from an initial point on the map and following the slope of the mountains.
* Render the view in 3d with an OpenGL layout.
* Each map generation is associated to a seed in order to easily regenerate the same map in the future
